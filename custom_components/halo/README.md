# Home Assistant Custom Component for Halo

This custom component for Halo/Avi-on lights manages [HALO HOME HLB6 Series 6 in. 2700K-5000K Tunable CCT Smart Integrated LED White Recessed Downlight, Round Trim](https://www.homedepot.com/p/HLB6-Series-6-in-2700K-5000K-Tunable-CCT-Smart-Integrated-LED-White-Recessed-Downlight-Round-Trim-1-Qty-HLB6099BLE40AWH/314912175) lights.

Instead of communicating through Bluetooth, this integration relies on the [Halo Access Bridge](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Enabled-Internet-Access-Halo/dp/B079TBGYZ7).

## Alternatives
